#Type Exercise Instructions

One of the most important tasks in web design is organizing the content/ message into logical groups and establishing of hierarchy of importance. This can be obtained through typographic manipulation and setting up a visual hierarchy - an arrangement of elements in a graduated series, from the most important to the least important. In this assignment, the same text will be gradually manipulated in order to reinforce the message and establish hierarchy.
